# Builders – Agency Website

This repository contains the marketing website for **Builders**, a web development agency.

It's a clean, fast and modern site used to showcase our services, past work, and provide an easy way for potential clients to reach out.

## ✨ Description

The website is not a web app – it's simply a **presentation site** designed to introduce the agency, what we do, and how we can help businesses grow online.

Some typical content sections include:

- Hero with messaging and call-to-action
- Services offered (web development, UI/UX, consulting, etc.)
- Contact form or email CTA

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

The stack is intentionally light — focused on performance and motion:

- **React** + **Vite** (front-end structure and component model)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Three.js** for subtle interactive backgrounds / visuals
- **GSAP** for animations and page transitions

No backend. Static content + motion. Can be deployed to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
